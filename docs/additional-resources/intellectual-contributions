# ESIIL's Guideline for Intellectual Contributions and Credit
ESIIL's guidelines for intellectual contributions and credit take a comprehensive and inclusive
approach to contributorship, as per Allen et al. 2019 and the CRediT taxonomy (Brand et al.
2015). We advocate for contributions that adhere to the principles of open science while also
respecting data sovereignty (Carroll et al. 2020). We urge all ESIIL participants to implement
these guidelines in all our endorsed research and educational ventures. We acknowledge that
different disciplines, sectors, and institutions may have unique approaches to contributions,
credit, and authorship. However, we strongly advise teams to develop an agreement around
contributions and credit, which should be regularly revisited and updated throughout the project.
When in doubt, lean towards giving credit rather than withholding it.

**Guidelines:**
1. Initiate early and ongoing conversations among teams about expectations and roles,
acknowledging that these may change over time. Teams should document these discussions
and formalize their decisions (e.g., such as through an authorship agreement form and
contributions table).
2. Honor various forms of contribution, for example, the categories from the CRediT taxonomy:
Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation,
Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation,
Visualization, Writing – original draft, and Writing – review & editing (and there may be other
forms of contribution not adequately addressed here);
3. Consider including author contributions in publications, even if it is not a requirement of the
journal or other outlet;
4. Clarify how credit is attributed to early-career scientists, and ensure that mechanisms are in
place to actively involve them in the contribution process;
5. Create leadership opportunities for, and promote the contributions of, members of
underrepresented communities in work outputs;
6. Where appropriate, provide open access publication of products throughout the entire
scientific process, including pre-prints (Hoy 2020) and for data, tools, code, models, educational
materials, manuscripts, and other intellectual contributions;
7. Consider alternative author listings that provide better recognition of contributions, such as
shared and indicated lead author roles, team author names for very large author groups, and/or
tiered authorship based on efforts;
8. Consider open source licenses when publishing;
9. Explore ways to track success beyond traditional publication citations, for example, altmetrics
that capture attention and engagement on digital platforms, patents and inventions, policy
impact, among others.
These guidelines on intellectual contribution and credit are intended to create a safe intellectual
space for idea exchange, acknowledgment of individual contributions, and facilitation of
large-scale collaborations.
