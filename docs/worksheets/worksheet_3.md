Please complete the warm-up with your team, briefly review today’s objectives, and carefully read the Day 2 and Day 3 report out items to guide your efforts.  

## Objectives for Day 2

2. Practice joining your datasets together. 
3. Discuss and try creating interesting graphics.
4. Report back on your results at the end of the day. Today’s report back is short and focused on your team process. The Day 3 report back is more detailed.

## Day 2 Report Back
Day 2 report-back questions are about the team *process*. We are interested in your team’s unique experience. Below are some prompts you might consider. You don't need to address all of them - choose which ones you want to present. Please limit your reflection to 2-3 mins.  

1. **What worked well for your team?**
3. **What’s one thing you would change?**
4. **Did your group ever have an “ah-ha” moment?  What led up to that moment?**
5. **Did your group experience the groan zone?  What is one tip you want to share with future groups at the Summit about getting through the groan zone?**
     - [insert your group reflection responses here]

### Looking Ahead: Day 3 Report Back
*These are the prompts for the final Report Back **tomorrow (Day 3)** - start thinking about these questions as you work today. Each group will share their Day 3 GitHub page on the screen and give a 4 minute presentation.*

- **Project Title:**
- **Research Question:**
- **One interesting graphic/finding:**
- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
- **What’s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
      
### Reminder
