# Group 9 -- Incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in decision-making
Summary
The team introductions included members of the existing ESIIL working groups. We have people with a significant number of superpowers in AI, data processing, computer systems, collaborative work, data collection, mapping, coding, engineering, wireless interconnection hardware and software, and climate data. There are observations about how to communicate climate challenges to traditional communities and how to explain ecological knowledge, as this traditional knowledge in most of the communities is passed through traditions instead of a system-based structure. The concept of cosmos and traditional knowledge is integral and interconnected, and the general idea is to guide people to a living purpose. 
Traditional knowledge includes practices, memorization, oral languages and traditional interactions and many other intangibles. 

!!! Success "Provocative question"
Main discussion: The main discussion was about protecting and preserving traditional and inherent language(s) and other holistic knowledge through data sovereignty. 
    How can traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) be incorporated into co-created decision-making processes to enhance environmental and community resilience?
